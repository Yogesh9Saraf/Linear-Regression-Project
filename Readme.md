Linear regression model using Python

Used Python to build a linear regression model for a company to determine CTC/ Salary for new hires based on their past employment data.

Q1. What are your thoughts on the problem statement
The problem's description asks for developing a machine learning model to forecast TechWorks Consulting new hires' salaries.

It highlights how crucial it is to provide equitable and consistent pay depending on a range of criteria, including experience, education level, city type, role, prior CTC, and other pertinent characteristics.

Regression models are used to forecast pay, and statistical analysis and data pretreatment are emphasized

2. What will be your approach to solving this task?
The following crucial actions would be part of my strategy for completing this task:

1) Data Loading and Understanding: In order to evaluate the target variable's (salary) distribution, load the dataset, comprehend its properties.

2) Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, outliers, and creating dummy variables for the "Role" column in addition to converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

3) Data exploration: To learn more about feature correlations and distributions, visualize and analyze the data.

4) Model Selection: Select regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) that are appropriate for wage prediction.

5) Model Training and Evaluation: Divide the data, use measures like Mean Squared Error and R-squared to assess the model's performance.

6) Multiple Model Comparison (Optional): You can also experiment with various regression models to find the best performing model.
3. What were the available ML model options you had to perform this task?
The available machine learning model options for this regression task include, but are not limited to:

1) Linear Regression
2) Ridge & Lasso Regression 
3) Decision Trees
4) Random Forest
5) Gradient Boosting
6) XGBoot Boosting
These models are suitable for predicting continuous values, making them appropriate for predicting CTC.

4. Which model’s performance is best and what could be the possible reason for that?
To determine the best-performing model, the results are as follows:- The model with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) or highest R-squared value is considered the best performer

the performance of different regression models based on R-squared scores and Mean Squared Errors is as follows:

1) Linear Regression:
    
    R-squared Score: 0.5356
    Mean Squared Error: 68909870.6995

2) Ridge Regression:
    
    R-squared Score: 0.5354
    Mean Squared Error: 68945113.8787

3) Lasso Regression:

    R-squared Score: 0.5356
    Mean Squared Error: 68908039.5780

4) Decision Tree:

    R-squared Score: 0.3505
    Mean Squared Error: 96376217.8147

5) Random Forest:

    R-squared Score: 0.6605
    Mean Squared Error: 50371251.2528

6) Gradient Boosting:

    R-squared Score: 0.6120
    Mean Squared Error: 57568209.2825

7) XGBoost:

    R-squared Score: 0.6130
    Mean Squared Error: 57425119.4255


The Random Forest model stands out with the highest R-squared score and the lowest Mean Squared Error, suggesting superior predictive performance compared to the other models. 

Factors contributing to its success include ensemble learning, consideration of feature importance, robustness to outliers, flexibility in handling various types of features, and the availability of tuning options.

Q5. What steps can you take to improve this selected model’s performance even further?
To further improve the performance of the selected Random Forest model, consider the following steps:

Hyperparameter Tuning:
• Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model. Adjust parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples per leaf, and the maximum number of features considered for splitting. Grid search or randomized search can help in finding optimal hyperparameter values.

Feature Engineering:
• Explore additional feature engineering techniques. Identify and create new features that might better capture the underlying patterns in the data. Feature scaling or normalization can also be beneficial, especially if features have different scales.

Address Overfitting:
• Random Forest models are less prone to overfitting, but it's still essential to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. Adjust the maximum depth of trees or increase the minimum samples per leaf to control overfitting.

Cross-Validation:
• Implement cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple folds of the dataset. This helps ensure the model's robustness and provides a more accurate estimate of its generalization performance.

Ensemble Methods:
• Consider combining the Random Forest model with other ensemble methods or stacking models to leverage the strengths of different algorithms. This can lead to improved predictive performance.

Data Quality:
• Examine the dataset for missing values, outliers, or errors. Clean and preprocess the data accordingly. Addressing data quality issues can contribute to a more reliable model.

Feature Importance Analysis:
• Reevaluate the feature importance analysis provided by the Random Forest model. If certain features are deemed less relevant, consider removing or transforming them to potentially enhance model performance.

Model Interpretability:
• If interpretability is crucial, explore techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to better understand the impact of each feature on the model's predictions.

Advanced Techniques:
• Explore more advanced techniques such as gradient boosting or XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters to compare performance and potentially achieve even better results.
